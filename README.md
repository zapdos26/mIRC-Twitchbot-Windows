This is a Twitch Bot I created to help streamers and moderators who want to run multiple mIRC bots on a single Windows server/computer. These scripts are created to be easily adjustable settings which can be done via chat, the ability to change commands and timers via chat, and to autorun on restart of a server or computer.

The focus of the bot is fit the needs of the streamer, not the streamer fit the needs of the bot. With that, if the bot doesn't have something a streamer wants, the bot has built in capabilities to allow for that. If a script is created with [#usernameofstreamer]scripts.ini, you can add your own custom scripts into the bot. Just make sure the #usernameofstreamer is inside the script instead of # to make sure the commands don't work in the other streams.

A list of commands can be found here: https://goo.gl/o1Otwc

The bot currently runs as Jellie_bot in GoodTimesWithScar's streams, D_A_I_N_A in zueljin's streams, Welsbot in Welsknight streams, and Ak47PomPoms in Chickenb0ne's streams.

Currently, Zapdosbot is in public beta in Zapdos26's channel (https://www.twitch.tv/zapdos26) with it being able to come into your channel for either testing or for actual use. :) Just do !join and if the bot is modded in your channel, it will remain in your channel unless you either do !part or you unmod the bot.

If you have any questions, feel free to tweet me at @zapdos26.
